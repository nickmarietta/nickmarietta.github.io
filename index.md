### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because I was always interested in how 
    people had always made programs such as these. Filling in the blank 
    was very fun and I believe helped me understood how cin works. I was able 
    to use cin effectively and have fun with the process.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my other favorites because I really liked the
    aspect of the guessing game. With two users interacting with the program, 
    I thought that it was very cool how the nested loops worked with each other 
    to function this way. I believe that this was the best introduction to 
    nested loops.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was my all-time favorite because of the image it created. 
    When first getting into programming, I thought that it was only used for 
    things such as webpages or games. This program made me realize the true 
    reaches that coding can be applied to which I really enjoyed. Not only 
    did this program help me realize that, but also how classes work.
